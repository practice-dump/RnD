## Just a place to dump interesting gits

* [Ranger](https://github.com/lessw2020/Ranger-Deep-Learning-Optimizer) : a synergistic optimizer combining RAdam (Rectified Adam) and LookAhead, and now GC (gradient centralization) in one optimizer.
* [Mish](https://github.com/digantamisra98/Mish) - An activation function
* [Anycost GAN](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/anycost-gan) - Interesting tool to play with images, possibly Pixel editing software works on similar technology
